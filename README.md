# MediaLog

MediaLog is your movie and tv diary. Inspired by my dad who gets 30 minutes into a movie before realizing he had seen it already, MediaLog helps you look up items that you have added to your Watched List to track what you've seen already. It is a lightweight application that allows you to easily search and add media via [TMDb](http://themoviedb.org).
